The company serves 70+ million customers daily through company-owned restaurants (~7,000) and franchised locations (~33,000). Beyond traditional dining, McDonald's has aggressively expanded into digital ordering, delivery partnerships (Uber Eats, DoorDash), and drive-thru automation to meet evolving consumer demands.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Industry and Size\nOperating in the **Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry**, McDonald's generates ~$23 billion in annual revenue with 200,000+ corporate employees globally. The company manages complex technology ecosystems including POS systems, mobile apps (50+ million active users), supply chain management, franchise management systems, and customer loyalty programs across diverse global markets with varying regulatory requirements.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf0 Recent Developments\nMcDonald's is heavily investing in **technology modernization** and **AI-driven solutions**. Recent initiatives include expanding self-service kiosks, piloting AI-powered drive-thru voice ordering, implementing predictive analytics for inventory management, and launching \"McD Tech Labs\" for innovation. The company is also modernizing its franchise management systems and enhancing data analytics capabilities to optimize operations across its vast network.\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Key Pain Points for OutSystems\n- **Legacy system integration challenges** across 40,000+ locations with inconsistent technology stacks\n- **Rapid application development needs** for franchise management, supply chain, and customer-facing solutions\n- **Global scalability requirements** with local customization for different markets and regulations  \n- **Complex data orchestration** between POS, mobile apps, loyalty programs, and operational systems\n- **Speed-to-market pressure** for digital initiatives to compete with tech-forward competitors like Starbucks and emerging delivery-first brands\n\n*OutSystems' low-code platform could accelerate McDonald's digital transformation by enabling rapid development of integrated solutions that connect legacy systems while supporting global scale and local customization.*",
